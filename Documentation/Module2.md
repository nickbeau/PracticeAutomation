# Module 2
In this module we learn how to send happy birthday emails to a list in SharePoint Online

Please note to accomplish this we use an advanced flow function called dayOfYear which calculates the day of the year of a certain date. It has not been tested in leap years.

## Flows
* [HappyBirthdayFlow](../Flows/HappyBirthdayFlow.zip) - This flow automates sending an email to clients on their birthday

## Data
[BirthdayList](../Data/BirthdayList.xlsx) - This Excel file contains the list of computer generated names, first names, email addresses and dates of Birth
